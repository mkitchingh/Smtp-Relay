# Windows SMTP Relay Service
Windows SMTP Relay Service with GUI configuration tool.
Micorosft removed the built in SMTP relay server from Windows. This is a replacement. It is actively being developed and I will always try to keep it up to to date with current technologies.
Config GUI shown below. All options are pretty basic and self explanatory. Service will continue to run when the GUI is closed. It only listens on port 25.
