# Windows SMTP Relay Service
Microsoft removed the built in SMTP relay server from Windows. This is a replacement.
Every other option I could find was no longer developed, overkill, or lacking features unless you used the paid version. 
It is actively being developed and I will always try to keep it up to to date with current technologies.
Config GUI shown below. All options are pretty basic and self explanatory. Service will continue to run when the GUI is closed. It only listens on port 25.
GUI will launch after install. It may take a few seconds while Windows scans it for the first time. Start menu shortcut is named SMTP Relay Config. 
Current release: https://github.com/mkitchingh/Smtp-Relay/releases/tag/v1.4

**You may see Windows Defender or Unknown Publisher messages when you install. I'd prefer not to pay the code signing certificate cost, but I will if it causes a problem for people.
